# knowID
KnowID is an application that allows you to trace the genealogy of music sampling through a network graph.

It uses cheerio.js and request.js to collect data for the visualization, while managing the asynchronicity with the async.js library.  

It then uses D3.js to create a network graph showing how songs are layered with various samples from other songs, maybe incorporating a guitar riff or a drum loop. Each vertex on the graph is clickable, allowing you to play both songs or see the relevant musical element that relates the two songs and general info surrounding the song. 

Some additions that I'd like to work on are extending the amount of songs per artist to beyond 10 of their most popular songs, an improvement of the UI & CSS to make it visually more pleasing, and a more complex network that will relate songs based on their samples.
